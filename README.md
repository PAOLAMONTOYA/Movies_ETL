### The Scope
#### Britta needs to extract data from multipe sites and combine them into 1 central site to be able to access data more efficiently. In order to do this, Britta used the ETL method. It consisted of extracting the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
